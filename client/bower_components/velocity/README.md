###**Comparisons**

Famo.us is a full-fledged mobile app framework built around a physics engine. It has the potential to beat all DOM-based animation libraries in terms of performance. The amount of work Steve Newcomb and Mark Lu have put into vertically integrating the Famous development stack is astounding.

GSAP is a full-fledged animation platform with a ton of power. Its features are nearly limitless -- as is the love its creator (Jack Doyle) puts into it. GSAP is what inspired me to pursue the development of Velocity.

As for Velocity, its focus is on being a very lightweight, very fast tool for drastically improving UI animation performance and workflow. I put an extensive amount of work and attention to detail into it.

With each of these solutions, we're comparing options that are the product of nothing but love -- for performance and for the Web. Choose whichever is best suited to your task at-hand. They're all very fast.
