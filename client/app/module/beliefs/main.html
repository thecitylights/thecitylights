    <p> I believe in one God, <br>
        the Father almighty, <br>
        maker of heaven and earth, <br>
        of all things visible and invisible. <br>

        <p>I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, <br>
        the Only Begotten Son of God, <br>
        born of the Father before all ages. <br>
        God from God, Light from Light, <br>
        true God from true God, <br>
        begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; <br>
        through him all things were made. <br>
        For us men and for our salvation<br>
        he came down from heaven,<br>
        and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,<br>
        and became man.<br>
        For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,<br>
        he suffered death and was buried,<br>
        and rose again on the third day<br>
        in accordance with the Scriptures.<br>
        He ascended into heaven<br>
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
        He will come again in glory<br>
        to judge the living and the dead<br>
        and his kingdom will have no end.</p>

        <p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
        who proceeds from the Father and the Son,<br>
        who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,<br>
        who has spoken through the prophets.</p>

        <p>I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.<br>
        I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins<br>
        and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead<br>
        and the life of the world to come.</p>
        <p>Amen.</p>
